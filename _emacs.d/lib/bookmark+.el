;;  If you have library `linkd.el' and Emacs 22 or later, load
;;  `linkd.el' and turn on `linkd-mode' now.  It lets you easily
;;  navigate around the sections of this doc.  Linkd mode will
;;  highlight this Index, as well as the cross-references and section
;;  headings throughout this file.  You can get `linkd.el' here:

;;  Documentation
;;  -------------
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark+ Features")
;;  ** Bookmark+ Features **
;;
;;  * New types of bookmarks, and additional recorded information:
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a buffer that is not associated with a file.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a Gnus article.
;;
;;     - You can bookmark a Dired buffer, recording and restoring its
;;       switches and marked files.
;;
;;     - For any bookmark (except Gnus), you can bookmark a region of
;;       text, not just a position.  By default, when you jump to a
;;       bookmark that records a region, the region is activated.  See
;;       option `bookmarkp-use-region-flag'.  `C-u' reverses the
;;       behavior specified by the value of the option.
;;
;;     - Bookmarks record the number of visits and the time of last
;;       visit.
;;
;;     - You can tag bookmarks.  A bookmark can have any number of
;;       tags, and multiple bookmarks can have the same tag.
;;
;;  * Better bookmark relocation when the contextual text changes.
;;
;;  * Improvements for the menu list (buffer `*Bookmark List*'):
;;
;;     - You can sort bookmarks in various ways.
;;     - You can search or query-replace the destinations of the
;;       marked bookmarks (in the current order).  For Emacs 23 and
;;       later, this includes incremental multi-search.
;;     - Enhanced marking/unmarking, similar to that in Dired.
;;     - You can mark or show different classes of bookmarks.
;;     - Faces distinguish bookmarks by type.
;;     - You can edit a bookmark (its name and file name).
;;
;;  If you also use Icicles, you can use `S-delete' during completion
;;  for a bookmark name, to delete the current bookmark candidate.
;;  See http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.
;;
;;(@* "Installing Bookmark+")
;;  ** Installing Bookmark+ **
;;
;;  Put this library in your `load-path'.
;;  Add this to your init file (~/.emacs) : (require 'bookmark+)
;;
;;(@* "Bookmarks Menu List")
;;  ** Bookmarks Menu List **
;;
;;  Bookmark+ enhances the bookmarks list (the "menu list") that is
;;  displayed in buffer `*Bookmark List*' when you use `C-x r l'
;;  (`bookmark-bmenu-list').  Bookmarks are highlighted to indicate
;;  their type. You can show or hide bookmarks of particular types,
;;  mark and unmark bookmarks, and much more.  Use `C-h m' in buffer
;;  `*Bookmark List*' for more information.
;;
;;  (Note: Bookmark+ uses option `bookmarkp-sort-comparer'; it ignores
;;  vanilla Emacs option `bookmark-sort-flag'.)
;;
;;(@* "Marking and Unmarking Bookmarks")
;;  *** Marking and Unmarking Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  Bookmark+ enhances marking and unmarking of bookmarks in several
;;  ways.  In general, these enhancements are similar to features
;;  offered by Dired and Dired-X.
;;
;;  * You can use `% m' to mark bookmarks that match a regexp.  The
;;    entire bookmark line in the menu list is checked for a match.
;;
;;  * You can use `M-DEL' (or `U') to unmark all bookmarks, or all
;;    that are marked `>', or all that are flagged `D'.
;;
;;  * You can use `t' to toggle (swap) marked and unmarked bookmarks:
;;    the marked become unmarked, and vice versa.
;;
;;  * You can use `>' to show only the marked bookmarks or `<' to show
;;    only the unmarked bookmarks.  Repeat to show all again.
;;
;;  * You can use `F M', `I M' etc. to mark only file bookmarks, Info
;;    bookmarks etc.
;;
;;(@* "Filtering: Hiding and Showing Bookmarks")
;;  *** Filtering: Hiding and Showing Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  You can hide and show different sets of bookmarks in the menu
;;  list.  There are commands to show only bookmarks of a particular
;;  type - e.g. `I S' to show only Info bookmarks.  These are, in
;;  effect, shortcuts for first marking those bookmarks and then
;;  showing only the marked bookmarks (and then unmarking).  For
;;  example, `F S' is a shortcut for `F M >' (and then `U RET').
;;
;;  You can also filter to show only the bookmarks that match a
;;  regexp.  There are two ways to do this:
;;
;;  * Use `P B' (for "pattern", "bookmark") and type a regexp.  The
;;    bookmarks are filtered incrementally, as you type.  Only the
;;    bookmark name is matched.  Hit any non-inserting key, such as
;;    `RET', to stop defining the pattern.
;;
;;    Similarly, hit `P F' for bookmarks whose file names match a
;;    regexp, and `P T' for bookmarks with one or more tags that match
;;    a regexp.  See (@> Bookmark Tags), below, for information about
;;    tags.
;;
;;  * Just as in Dired, use `% m' to mark the bookmarks that match a
;;    regexp.  The entire bookmark line in the menu list (bookmark
;;    name and perhaps file name) is searched for a match.
;;
;;    Then use `>' to show only the marked bookmarks.  This method has
;;    the advantage that you can show the complement: the bookmarks
;;    that do *not* match the regexp, by using `<' instead of `>'.  It
;;    also has the advantage/disadvantage that matching checks the
;;    combination of bookmark name and file name.
;;
;;  Commands that operate on the current bookmark or on the marked or
;;  the unmarked bookmarks act only on bookmarks that are displayed
;;  (not hidden).  This includes the commands that mark or unmark
;;  bookmarks.  This means that you can easily define any given set of
;;  bookmarks.
;;
;;  For example:
;;
;;    Use `F S' to show only bookmarks associated with files.
;;    Use `% m' to mark those that match a particular regexp.
;;    Use `R S' to show only bookmarks that have regions.
;;    Use `m' to mark some of those region bookmarks individually.
;;    Use `.' to show all bookmarks.
;;    Use `t' to swap marked and unmarked (so unmarked are now marked)
;;    Use `D' to delete all of the marked bookmarks (after confirming)
;;
;;  That deletes all file bookmarks that match the regexp and all
;;  region bookmarks that you selectively marked.
;;
;;(@* "Sorting Bookmarks")
;;  *** Sorting Bookmarks ***
;;
;;  Filtering hides certain kinds of bookmarks.  Sometimes, you want
;;  to see bookmarks of various kinds, but you want them to be grouped
;;  or sorted in different ways, for easy recognition, comparison, and
;;  access.
;;
;;  Bookmarks shown in the menu list are sorted using the current
;;  value of option `bookmark-sort-function'.  (If that is nil, they
;;  are unsorted, which means they appear in reverse chronological
;;  order of their creation.)
;;
;;  You can use `s s'... (repeat hitting the `s' key) to cycle among
;;  the various sort orders possible.  By default, all available sort
;;  orders are cycled, but you can shorten the cycling list by
;;  customizing option `bookmarkp-sort-orders-for-cycling-alist'.
;;
;;  You can also change directly to one of the main sort orders
;;  (without cycling) using `s n', `s f n', etc. - use `C-h m' for
;;  more info.
;;
;;  You can reverse the current sort direction (ascending/descending)
;;  using `s r'.
;;
;;  For a complex sort, which involves composing several sorting
;;  conditions, you can also use `s C-r' to reverse the order of
;;  bookmark sorting groups or the order within each group (depending
;;  on whether `s r' is also used).  Be aware that this can be a bit
;;  unintuitive.  If it does not do what you expect or want, or if it
;;  confuses you, then don't use it. ;-) (`s C-r' has no noticeable
;;  effect on simple sorting.)
;;
;;  Remember that you can combine sorting with hiding/showing
;;  different sets of bookmarks - bookmarks of different kinds
;;  (e.g. Info) or bookmarks that are marked or unmarked.
;;
;;  Finally, you can easily define your own sorting commands and sort
;;  orders.  See macro `bookmarkp-define-sort-command' and the
;;  documentation for option `bookmarkp-sort-comparer'.
;;
;;(@* Bookmark Tags)
;; ** Bookmark Tags **
;;
;;  With Bookmark+ you can bookmark several kinds of Emacs object.
;;  Bookmarks record locations - that is their primary purpose.  They
;;  can also record annotations: general free-text descriptions of
;;  your choosing.
;;
;;  Bookmark+ bookmarks can also be tagged, in del.icio.us style, as a
;;  way to organize them, which also means as a way to organize the
;;  objects that are bookmarked.  A bookmark tag is a string that
;;  contains no newline characters.
;;
;;  You can add as many tags as you like to any bookmark, and multiple
;;  bookmarks can have the same tag(s).  In fact, that's the whole
;;  idea behind using them for organizing.
;;
;;  This feature is unrelated to the fact that bookmarks record
;;  locations and are useful for navigating.  You can, if you want,
;;  use bookmarks to tag files in various ways purely for purposes of
;;  organizing them (e.g. into projects), whether or not you ever use
;;  the bookmarks as a way to visit them.
;;
;;  For example, if you also use library `dired+.el', then you can use
;;  `M-b' (`diredp-do-bookmark') in Dired to create a bookmark for
;;  each of the marked files in the Dired buffer.  Even if you never
;;  use those bookmarks for navigating to the files, you can use them
;;  with tags to organize the files.
;;
;;  To make tags more useful, Bookmark+ provides lots of commands: for
;;  adding or removing tags, and for marking or unmarking bookmarks
;;  that are tagged in various ways.  When combined with other
;;  Bookmark+ commands (e.g. search, query-replace) that apply to the
;;  marked bookmarks in the `*Bookmarks List*' window, you can really
;;  do quite a lot using bookmark tags.  Use your imagination!
;;
;;  There are lots of tags-related bookmark commands, and they are all
;;  bound to keys in buffer `*Bookmarks List*'.  How to keep them
;;  straight or remember the keys?  `C-h m' is your friend, of course.
;;  And the tag-related keys are organized as follows:
;;
;;    They all have the prefix key `T'.
;;
;;    `m' means mark
;;    `u' means unmark
;;    `>' stands for the marked bookmarks
;;    `*' means AND (set intersection; all)
;;    `+' means OR  (set union; some/any)
;;    `~' means NOT (set complement)
;;
;;  The key `T m *', for instance, marks the bookmarks that are tagged
;;  with all of a given set of tags.  It prompts you for one or more
;;  tags that the bookmarks must have, and it marks all bookmarks that
;;  have all of the tags you enter.
;;
;;  The key `T u ~ +' unmarks the bookmarks that do not have any of
;;  the tags you specify.  And so on.  Marking and unmarking commands
;;  compare the tags a bookmark has with tags you enter.  Any
;;  bookmarks that have no tags are ignored - they are neither marked
;;  nor unmarked by these commands.
;;
;;  `+' and `-' can also mean add and remove tags, respectively, and
;;  `>' stands for the marked bookmarks.  So `T > +' adds one or more
;;  tags to all of the marked bookmarks.
;;
;;  In general, the tag-related commands let you enter a set of tags,
;;  one at a time.  Thus, instead of having a command to add a single
;;  tag to the current bookmark, you have a command to add any number
;;  of tags to it.  To add just a single tag, you hit `RET' twice:
;;  once to enter the tag, and once again to indicate that it's the
;;  last one.
;;
;;  If you just hit `RET' immediately, specifying an empty set of
;;  tags, then each of the commands does something reasonable.
;;  For `T m *', for instance, an empty list of tags means to mark the
;;  bookmarks that have any tags at all.
;;
;;  Finally, for the marking/unmarking commands, a prefix argument
;;  flips the sense of the command:
;;
;;    "some" -> "some are not", i.e., "not all are" (and vice versa)
;;    "all"  -> "all are not", i.e., "none are" (and vice versa)
;;
;;  In other words:
;;
;;    C-u T m *    =  T m ~ +  (all are not  = not some are)
;;    C-u T m ~ +  =  T m *    (not some are = all are not)
;;    C-u T m +    =  T m ~ *  (some are not = not all are)
;;    C-u T m ~ *  =  T m +    (not all are  = some are not)
;;
;;  You'll figure it out.
;;
;;  The best way to think about tags is as names of sets.  All
;;  bookmarks tagged `blue' constitute the bookmark set named `blue'.
;;
;;  The marking commands make it easy to combine sets as unions or
;;  intersections.  And you can give the result a name for quick
;;  access later, just by adding a new tag.  in other words, do the
;;  set-definition work only once, and name the result.  For example,
;;  to tag as `Java IDE Projects' the bookmarks that are already
;;  tagged both `Java' and `ide':
;;
;;    1. Mark those bookmarks, using `T m * Java RET ide RET RET'.
;;    2. Tag them, using `T + Java IDE Projects RET RET.
;;
;;  How would you query-replace the set of files that are tagged with
;;  any of the tags `alpha', `beta', and `gamma', but are not tagged
;;  `blue' or `moon'?
;;
;;    1. `F S', to show only the file bookmarks.
;;    2. `T m + alpha RET beta RET gamma RET RET', to mark the
;;       bookmarks that have at least one of those tags.
;;    3. `T u + blue RET red', to unmark those that are blue or red.
;;    4. `M-q' to query-replace the marked files.
;;
;;  If that's a set of files that you use often, then name the set by
;;  giving the files a new tag.
;;
;;(@* "Bookmark Compatibility with Vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el')")
;;  ** Bookmark Compatibility with Vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el') **
;;
;;  Library `bookmark+.el' is generally compatible with GNU Emacs
;;  versions 20 through 23.
;;
;;  1. All bookmarks created using any version of vanilla Emacs
;;     (library `bookmark.el') continue to work with `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;  2. All bookmarks created using library `bookmark+.el' will work
;;     with all Emacs versions (20-23), provided you use library
;;     `bookmark+.el' to access them.
;;
;;  3. Most bookmarks created using `bookmark+.el' will not interfere
;;     with the behavior of vanilla Emacs, versions 21-23.  The new
;;     bookmark types are simply ignored by vanilla Emacs.  For
;;     example:
;;
;;     - A bookmark with a region is treated like a simple position
;;       bookmark: the destination is the region start position.
;;
;;     - A Gnus bookmark does not work; it is simply ignored.
;;
;;     However, there are two cases in which `bookmark+.el' bookmarks
;;     will raise an error in vanilla Emacs:
;;
;;     * You cannot use non-file (e.g. buffer-only) bookmarks with any
;;       version of vanilla Emacs.
;;
;;     * You cannot use any bookmarks created using `bookmark+.el'
;;       with vanilla Emacs 20.
;;
;;     The Emacs bookmark data structure has changed from version to
;;     version.  Library `bookmark+.el' always creates bookmarks that
;;     have the most recent structure (Emacs 23).  As is the case for
;;     any bookmarks that have the Emacs 23 structure, these bookmarks
;;     will not work in vanilla Emacs 20 (that is, without
;;     `bookmark+.el').
;;
;;  Bottom line: Use `bookmark+.el' to access bookmarks created using
;;  `bookmark+.el'.
;;
;;(@* "New Bookmark Structure")
;;  ** New Bookmark Structure **
;;
;;  The bookmark data structure, variable `bookmark-alist', has been
;;  enhanced to support new bookmark types.  For a description of this
;;  enhanced structure, use `C-h v bookmark-alist'.

  "*Predicate or predicates for sorting (comparing) bookmarks.
This defines the default sort for bookmarks in the menu list.

Various sorting commands, such as \\<bookmark-bmenu-mode-map>\
`\\[bookmarkp-bmenu-sort-by-bookmark-visit-frequency]', change the value of this
option dynamically (but they do not save the changed value).

The value must be one of the following:

* nil, meaning do not sort

* a predicate that takes two bookmarks as args

* a list of the form ((PRED...) FINAL-PRED), where each PRED and
  FINAL-PRED are predicates that take two bookmarks as args

If the value is a list of predicates, then each PRED is tried in turn
until one returns a non-nil value.  In that case, the result is the
car of that value.  If no non-nil value is returned by any PRED, then
FINAL-PRED is used and its value is the result.

Each PRED should return `(t)' for true, `(nil)' for false, or nil for
undecided.  A nil value means that the next PRED decides (or
FINAL-PRED, if there is no next PRED).

Thus, a PRED is a special kind of predicate that indicates either a
boolean value (as a singleton list) or \"I cannot decide - let the
next guy else decide\".  (Essentially, each PRED is a hook function
that is run using `run-hook-with-args-until-success'.)

Examples:

 nil           - No sorting.

 string-lessp  - Single predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

 ((p1 p2))     - Two predicates `p1' and `p2', which each return
                 (t) for true, (nil) for false, or nil for undecided.

 ((p1 p2) string-lessp)
               - Same as previous, except if both `p1' and `p2' return
                 nil, then the return value of `string-lessp' is used.

Note that these two values are generally equivalent, in terms of their
effect (*):

 ((p1 p2))
 ((p1) p2-plain) where p2-plain is (bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate p2)

Likewise, these three values generally act equivalently (*):

 ((p1))
 (() p1-plain)
 p1-plain        where p1-plain is (bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate p1)

The PRED form lets you easily combine predicates: use `p1' unless it
cannot decide, in which case try `p2', and so on.  The value ((p2 p1))
tries the predicates in the opposite order: first `p2', then `p1' if
`p2' returns nil.

Using a single predicate or FINAL-PRED makes it easy to reuse an
existing predicate that returns nil or non-nil.

You can also convert a PRED-type predicate (which returns (t), (nil),
or nil) into an ordinary predicate, by using function
`bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate'.  That lets you reuse elsewhere, as
ordinary predicates, any PRED-type predicates you define.

For example, this defines a plain predicate to compare bookmark names:
 (defalias 'bookmarkp-alpha-p
           (bookmarkp-make-plain-predicate 'bookmarkp-alpha-cp))

Note: As a convention, predefined Bookmark+ PRED-type predicate names
have the suffix `-cp' (for \"component predicate\") instead of `-p'.

--
* If you use `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]', then there is a difference in \
behavior between

   (a) using a plain predicate as FINAL-PRED and
   (b) using the analogous PRED-type predicate (and no FINAL-PRED).

  In the latter case, `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' affects when the predicate \
is tried and
  its return value.  See `bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order'."

Bookmark functions update the value automatically.
You probably do not want to change the value yourself.

The value is an alist with entries of the form
 (BOOKMARK-NAME . PARAM-ALIST)
or the deprecated form (BOOKMARK-NAME PARAM-ALIST).

 BOOKMARK-NAME is the name you gave to the bookmark when creating it.
 PARAM-ALIST is an alist of bookmark information.  The order of the
  entries in PARAM-ALIST is not important.  The possible entries are
  described below.  An entry with a key but null value means the entry
  is not used.

Bookmarks created using vanilla Emacs (`bookmark.el'):

 (filename . FILENAME)
 (position . POS)
 (front-context-string . STR-AFTER-POS)
 (rear-context-string  . STR-BEFORE-POS)
 (handler . HANDLER)
 (annotation . ANNOTATION)

 FILENAME names the bookmarked file.
 POS is the bookmarked buffer position (position in the file).
 STR-AFTER-POS is buffer text that immediately follows POS.
 STR-BEFORE-POS is buffer text that immediately precedes POS.
 ANNOTATION is a string that you can provide to identify the bookmark.
  See options `bookmark-use-annotations' and
  `bookmark-automatically-show-annotations'.
 HANDLER is a function that provides the bookmark-jump behavior
  for a specific kind of bookmark.  This is the case for Info
  bookmarks, for instance (starting with Emacs 23).

Bookmarks created using Bookmark+ are the same as for vanilla Emacs,
except for the following differences.

1. Visit information is recorded, using entries `visits' and `time':

 (visits . NUMBER-OF-VISITS)
 (time . TIME-LAST-VISITED)

 NUMBER-OF-VISITS is a whole-number counter.

 TIME-LAST-VISITED is an Emacs time representation, such as is
 returned by function `current-time'.

2. Bookmarks can be tagged by users.  The tag information is recorded
using entry `tags':

 (tags . TAGS-LIST)

 TAGS-LIST is a list of strings, the tags.

3. If no file is associated with the bookmark, then FILENAME is
   `   - no file -'.

4. The following additional entries are used to record region
information.  The values are non-nil only when a region is bookmarked.
When a region is bookmarked, POS represents the region start position.

 (buffer-name . BUFFER-NAME)
 (end-position . END-POS)
 (front-context-region-string . STR-BEFORE-END-POS)
 (rear-context-region-string . STR-AFTER-END-POS))

 BUFFER-NAME is the name of a bookmarked buffer, which might not be
  associated with any file (see #1).
 END-POS is the region end position.
 STR-BEFORE-END-POS is buffer text that precedes END-POS.
 STR-AFTER-END-POS is buffer text that follows END-POS.

 NOTE: The relative locations of `front-context-region-string' and
 `rear-context-region-string' are reversed from those of
 `front-context-string' and `rear-context-string'.  For example,
 `front-context-string' is the text that *follows* `position', but
 `front-context-region-string' that *precedes* `end-position'.

5. The following additional entries are used for a Dired bookmark.

 (dired-marked . MARKED-FILES)
 (dired-switches . SWITCHES)

 MARKED-FILES is the list of files that were marked.
 SWITCHES is the string of `dired-listing-switches'.

6. The following additional entries are used for a Gnus bookmark.

 (group . GNUS-GROUP-NAME)
 (article . GNUS-ARTICLE-NUMBER)
 (message-id . GNUS-MESSAGE-ID)

 GNUS-GROUP-NAME is the name of a Gnus group.
 GNUS-ARTICLE-NUMBER is the number of a Gnus article.
 GNUS-MESSAGE-ID is the identifier of a Gnus message.

7. For a W3M bookmark, FILENAME is a W3M URL.")

for prompting is as follows (in order of priority):

 * If the region is active and nonempty, then the buffer name followed

   `bookmarkp-bookmark-name-length-max' chars).

 * If in W3M mode, then the current W3M title.

 * If in Gnus Summary mode, then the Gnus summary article header.

 * Otherwise, the current buffer name.

While entering a bookmark name at the prompt:

 * You can use `C-w' to yank words from the buffer to the minibuffer.
   Repeating `C-w' yanks successive words.

 * You can use `C-u' to insert the name of the last bookmark used in
   the buffer.  This can be useful as an aid to track your progress
   through a large file.  (If no bookmark has yet been used, then
   `C-u' inserts the name of the visited file.)

With a prefix argument, do not overwrite a bookmark that has the same
name as NAME, if such a bookmark already exists.  Instead, push the
new bookmark onto the bookmark alist.

The most recently set bookmark named NAME is thus the one in effect at

you decide to delete the most recent one.

  "Reverse the application of multi-sorting predicates.
These are the PRED predicates described for option
`bookmark-sort-function'.

This reverses the order in which the predicates are tried, and it
also complements the truth value returned by each predicate.

For example, if the list of multi-sorting predicates is (p1 p2 p3),
then the predicates are tried in the order: p3, p2, p1.  And if a
predicate returns true, `(t)', then the effect is as if it returned
false, `(nil)', and vice versa.

The use of multi-sorting predicates tends to group bookmarks, with the
first predicate corresponding to the first bookmark group etc.

The effect of \\<bookmark-bmenu-mode-map>`\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' is \
roughly as follows:

 - without also `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-sort-order]', it reverses the bookmark order in each \
group

 - combined with `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-sort-order]', it reverses the order of the bookmark
   groups, but not the bookmarks within a group

This is a rough description.  The actual behavior can be complex,
because of how each predicate is defined.  If this description helps
you, fine.  If not, just experiment and see what happens. \;-)

Remember that ordinary `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-sort-order]' reversal on its own is \
straightforward.
If you find `\\[bookmarkp-reverse-multi-sort-order]' confusing or not helpful, then do not \
use it."
