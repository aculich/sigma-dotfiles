;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;     Removed (icomplete-mode 99) at end.
;; 2004/04/13 dadams
;;     I'm not sure that some of the "enhancements" here are still
;;     needed. This code was written long ago. In particular, I'm not
;;     sure that the changes to `icomplete-exhibit' and the
;;     redefinitions of the Emacs primitives are needed. Even if they
;;     are not needed, I'm leaving them in, as they are benign :).
;; 1995/12/15 dadams
;;     Defined replacements that reset minibuffer-completion-table to avoid
;;     icompletion: read-string, read-from-minibuffer, read-no-blanks-input.
;; 1995/11/30 dadams
;;     Added redefinition of yes-or-no-p.
;; 1995/10/17 dadams
;;     1) Added icomplete-choices-face and icomplete-determined-face.
;;     2) Redefined icomplete-exhibit: Doesn't insert if input
;;        begins with `('  (e.g. repeat-complex-command).

  "Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If non-nil, second arg INITIAL-INPUT is a string to insert before
    reading.  This argument has been superseded by DEFAULT-VALUE and
    should normally be `nil' in new code.  It behaves as in
    `read-from-minibuffer'.  See the documentation for that function.
The third arg HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list and
    optionally the initial position in that list.
    See `read-from-minibuffer' for details of argument HISTORY.
Fourth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value.  If non-nil, it is used
    for history commands and as the value to return if the user enters
    an empty string.
Fifth arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer
    inherits the current input method and setting of
    `enable-multibyte-characters'."

(defsubst read-from-minibuffer
  (prompt
   &optional initial-contents keymap read hist default-value inherit-input-method)
  "Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to
  DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when
  HIST is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.
Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use while reading.
  If omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.
If fourth arg READ is non-nil, then interpret the result as a lisp
  object and return that object.  In other words, do this:
      `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'
Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
  the initial position in the list.
  It can be a symbol, which is the history list variable to use,
  or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history-list variable to use,
  and HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer
  history commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that
  element of the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.
  Positions are counted starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.
Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value.  If non-nil, it is
  available for history commands; but, unless READ is non-nil,
  `read-from-minibuffer' does NOT return DEFAULT-VALUE if the user
  enters empty input!  It returns the empty string.
Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer
  inherits the current input method and the setting of
  `enable-multibyte-characters'.
If variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil, then the
  string returned includes whatever text properties were present in
  the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.

The remainder of this documentation describes INITIAL-CONTENTS in more
detail.  It is relevant only when studying existing code, or when HIST
is a cons.  If non-nil, INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted
into the minibuffer before reading input.  Normally, point is put at
the end of that string.  However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING
. POSITION), the initial input is STRING, but point is placed at
_one-indexed_ position POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value
less than or equal to one puts point at the beginning of the string.
*Note* that this behavior differs from the way such arguments are used
in `completing-read' and some related functions, which use
zero-indexing for POSITION."

Arg PROMPT is a prompt string. Whitespace terminates the input.

If optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is non-nil, it should be a
string, which is used as initial input, with point positioned at the
end, so that a SPACE will accept the input. INITIAL-CONTENTS can
alternatively be a cons of a string and an integer. Such values are
treated as in `read-from-minibuffer', but are normally not useful in
this function.
